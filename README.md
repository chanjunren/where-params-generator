Simple Program to help output all fields in branches to improve branch coverage in projects

Todo / Cases to consider:
- Comments (Single and multiline)
- Generating objects with their respective nested branch params
- Outputting of text
- Support for biz exceptions
- Inner classes

- Todo: change logic for tokenizing

Assumptions: 
- No comments on the same line as a piece of code? Logic probably won't handle

Concepts / Things to look up for future development if necessary
- Java Syntax / Semantics
- Tokenizing
- AST
